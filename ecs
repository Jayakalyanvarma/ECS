what is ecs?
AWS ECS, or Amazon Elastic Container Service, is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run, manage, and scale Docker containers on a cluster of virtual machines managed by AWS or using AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers.

Cluster:
Definition: A cluster is a logical grouping of EC2 instances or AWS Fargate resources where you can run ECS tasks and services.

Task Definition:
Definition: A Task Definition is a blueprint for your application that describes how a Docker container should be launched and configured.
 A task definition is a JSON text file that describes an application's containers and specifies parameters for it.
Components:
Docker image
CPU and memory requirements.
Networking settings (VPC, subnets, security groups).
Container port mappings, environment variables, and volumes.


Task:
In Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), a task is an instance of a task definition within a cluster. A task definition is a JSON text file that describes an application's containers and specifies parameters for it.

Service:
Definition: A Service allows you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a Task Definition simultaneously.
